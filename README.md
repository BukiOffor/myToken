## MTK-TOKEN

This project uses nextjs, ethers and wagmi to create a decentralized application that transfers tokens from a senders wallet to a receipients wallet and authorises user to spend tokens. 

Each folder contains a readme file that talks specifically on what the folder represents. i hope you enjoy this.
